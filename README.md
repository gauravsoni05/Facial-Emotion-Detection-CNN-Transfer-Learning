# Facial-Emotion-Detection-CNN-Transfer-Learning
The objective of this project is to classify images based on the emotions they depict using various
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models. The goal is to evaluate and compare the performance of
different CNN architectures to identify the most effective model for accurate emotion recognition. This
involves training each model on the FER-2013 dataset and assessing their classification accuracy and
other relevant metrics.     
seven categories: (0=Angry, 1=Disgust, 2=Fear, 3=Happy, 4=Sad, 5=Surprise, 6=Neutral)
